  <!-- <column> defines which column should appear in the tables (can appear multiple times).
       If omitted, all columns are used. The following features (which can also be combined) are available. -->
  <!-- Pre-defined columns of BenchExec can be used: -->
  <column title="*name of a column produced by BenchExec: status, category, score, cputime, walltime, memUsage*"/>
  <!-- Data can be extracted using a pattern from the output of the tool
       (needs specific support in the tool-specific Python module): -->

  <!-- Rounding can be specified: -->
  <column title="..." numberOfDigits="*optional number of significant digits for presenting the value*">...</column>
  <!-- If input value has no unit, unit for output and conversion factor can be specified: -->
  <column title="..." displayUnit="*unit*" scaleFactor="*number*">...</column>
  <!-- Table cells can contain configurable link: -->
  <column title="..." href="*path relative to this file or absolute URL*">*(optional) text to appear in all cells of the column*</column>

         and all these results should be placed below each other in the table
